well as the lastest version of Firefox ESR. WebGL2.0 support is also
mandatory.
* **3dtiles:** Remove region, box and sphere properties of C3DTBoundingVolume.
They have been replaced by volume property which contains a THREE.Box3 (for
box) or a THREE.Sphere (for sphere or region). Initial bounding volume type
can be retrieved with the initialVolumeType property.

* **VectorTile:** Feature.pushCoordinatesValues() signature change from pushCoordinatesValues(feature, long, lat, normal) to pushCoordinatesValues(feature, coordIn, coordProj)
* **Feature:** Feature.pushCoordinates() change in arguments order from pushCoordinates(coordIn, feature) to pushCoordinates(feature, coordIn)
* **view:** View.pickCoordinates has been renamed to View.pickTerrainCoordinates and returns the coordinates in the referenceCrs of the view instead of in the crs of the tiledLayer extent.
* **3dtiles:** `C3DTBatchTable` constructor signature has changed from
C3DTBatchTable(buffer, binaryLength, batchLength, registeredExtensions) to
C3DTBatchTable(buffer, jsonLength, binaryLength, batchLength, registeredExtensions)
* **Style/Convert:** * `GeometryLayer.convert` options are moved in Style properties. Use
  * `Style.xxx.color`
  * `Style.xxx.base_altitude`
  * `Style.fill.extrusion_height`
  * `Style.stroke.width`
  * `Style.point.radius`
* `overrideAltitudeInToZero` layer options is removed use `Style.xxx.base_altitude` instead.
* **CameraUtils:** The headings used in CameraUtils are now counted clockwise (they were
previously counted counter-clockwise).
* **Feature:** FeatureCollection and Feature signature constructor are changed.
* **source:** the signature function of LASParser.parse and
PotreeBinParser.parse has changed.
* The signature of the `PotreeLayer` constructor has
changed.
* **3dtiles:** C3DTilesLayer tileIndex renamed to tileset.
* **3dtiles:** C3DTileset's index attribute renamed to tiles.
* 3D Tiles Tileset index attribute (stored in
layer.tileIndex.index) is now an array starting at 0.
* 3D Tiles extensions are now registered in the
registeredExtensions attribute of C3DTilesLayer. See
examples/3dtiles_batch_table.html for an example.
* C3DTExtensions expects for an object extending
C3DTAbstractExtension to manage a registered extension instead
of a parser.
* Rename core 3D Tiles classes: $3DTilesExtensions
becomes C3DTExtensions and $3dTilesAbstractExtension becomes
C3DTAbstractExtension and BatchTableHierarchyExtension becomes
C3DTBatchTableHierarchyExtension.

* New classes maching the 3D Tiles specification:
C3DTBatchTable, C3DTBoundingVolume, C3DTileset.

* Add attributes to 3D Tiles core classes indicating their type

* 3D Tiles tests updated.

* 3D Tiles documentation updated.
* **style:** `Style#text.halo` is not available anymore, and each
property of it as been place in the `text` object, with the `halo`
prefix: `haloWidth`, `haloColor` and `haloBlur`.
* **core:** `Feature#geometry` is no longer available, use
`Feature#geometries` instead.
* **style:** `Style#getTextAnchorPositionInCSS` has been renamed to
`Style#getTextAnchorPosition`.
* **view:** the signature of View#pickFeaturesAt has changed
* **style:** Style#setFromVectorTile no longer has a `zoom`
parameter. The `zoom` value is equal to `Style#minzoom`.
* **FileSource:** Source must be in Layer constructor options.
You couldn't add a source after a Layer instancing.
* **source:** To instance C3DtilesLayer, it's needed to instance C3DtilesSource too.
* **DEMUtils:** the method `DEMUtils.getElevationValueAt` only returns
a value now, if you want the previous object, use
`DEMUtils.getTerrainObjectAt` instead.
* **PointCloud:** To add points cloud, you need to instance:
- PointCloudSource to specify parameters to fetch data.
- PointCloudLayer to add this points cloud in viewer.
* **view:** Constructor signature changes.
* **source:** The projection option to instance a TMS and WMTS source is mandatory.
* **core:** * `x()`, `y()`, `z()`, `latitude()`, `longitude()` and `altitude()` have
been replaced by getters of the same names
* `setAltitude()` has been replaced by a setter on `altitude`
* the validity of a CRS is no longer check when doing conversion using
`as()`, so it needs to be checked beforehand if needed
* **view:** Adding a layer to a view, with a source not
instantiated (only as an object) is no longer supported, even in
deprecation mode.
* **core:** * crs() and this._crs, west(), east(), south() and north() are replaced by this.crs and getter west, east, south and north.
* The Function Extent.extentParent has renamed to Extent.tiledExtentParent.
* Remove PanoramaView, PanoramaLayer, StaticSource and PanoramaTileBuilder.
* **parser:** GpxParser doesn't return a THREE.Mesh anymore.
* **core:** Computing screen space error is changed, so tile subdivision are different.
* **renderer:** the API of TileMesh and LayeredMaterial have changed.
* **renderer:** LayeredMaterialConstants and RendererConstant have
been removed.
* **source:** the origin property of TMSSource has been replaced by a
boolean, isInverted, that serves the same goal, but using a boolean.
* **source:** the protocol property no longer exists, instead to test
the type of Source, one needs to use the property isSource, adapted to
each type: for example, isWMTSSource tells if the source is WMTSSource.
* **layer:** layer.options.mimetype is no longer supported, use
layer.format instead
* **gis:** ellipsoidSizes from Coordinates.js is no longer a
function but an object.
* **core:** change view.notifyChange signature and semantics
* **Core:** Before this change, `view.addLayer` was throwing some errors directly in
some cases, and rejecting the promise in others. This replaces the
former for the latter in all cases. If you relied on a try/catch block
surrounding `view.addLayer` to catch some undocumented errors, you need
to move your error handling code to your promise rejection handler.
* **core:** this modify the signature of all picking functions.
* the signature of Fetcher.texture has changed, and only
return a promise now, instead of an object containing the texture and
the promise.
* **core:** a Provider needs to return a Promise every time after
calling its executeCommand function.
* **vector:** feature collection are not merged anymore
* **vector:** GeoJSON2Feature now returns a Promise
* **core:** c3DEngine.renderViewTobuffer has been renamed renderViewToBuffer
and has a new signature.
* - `layer.options.mimetype` is removed in favor of `layer.format`.
- `WFS_Provider`: format should now be a proper mimetype. So `json`
  becomes `application/json`, `geojson` becomes `application/geojson`.
* **core:** KML_Provider and BuildingBox_Provider have been
removed, as well as getPointOrder from WFS_Provider.

well as the lastest version of Firefox ESR. WebGL2.0 support is also
mandatory.
* **3dtiles:** Remove region, box and sphere properties of C3DTBoundingVolume.
They have been replaced by volume property which contains a THREE.Box3 (for
box) or a THREE.Sphere (for sphere or region). Initial bounding volume type
can be retrieved with the initialVolumeType property.

* **VectorTile:** Feature.pushCoordinatesValues() signature change from pushCoordinatesValues(feature, long, lat, normal) to pushCoordinatesValues(feature, coordIn, coordProj)
* **Feature:** Feature.pushCoordinates() change in arguments order from pushCoordinates(coordIn, feature) to pushCoordinates(feature, coordIn)
* **view:** View.pickCoordinates has been renamed to View.pickTerrainCoordinates and returns the coordinates in the referenceCrs of the view instead of in the crs of the tiledLayer extent.
* **3dtiles:** `C3DTBatchTable` constructor signature has changed from
C3DTBatchTable(buffer, binaryLength, batchLength, registeredExtensions) to
C3DTBatchTable(buffer, jsonLength, binaryLength, batchLength, registeredExtensions)
* **Style/Convert:** * `GeometryLayer.convert` options are moved in Style properties. Use
  * `Style.xxx.color`
  * `Style.xxx.base_altitude`
  * `Style.fill.extrusion_height`
  * `Style.stroke.width`
  * `Style.point.radius`
* `overrideAltitudeInToZero` layer options is removed use `Style.xxx.base_altitude` instead.
* **CameraUtils:** The headings used in CameraUtils are now counted clockwise (they were
previously counted counter-clockwise).
* **Feature:** FeatureCollection and Feature signature constructor are changed.
* **source:** the signature function of LASParser.parse and
PotreeBinParser.parse has changed.
* The signature of the `PotreeLayer` constructor has
changed.
* **3dtiles:** C3DTilesLayer tileIndex renamed to tileset.
* **3dtiles:** C3DTileset's index attribute renamed to tiles.
* 3D Tiles Tileset index attribute (stored in
layer.tileIndex.index) is now an array starting at 0.
* 3D Tiles extensions are now registered in the
registeredExtensions attribute of C3DTilesLayer. See
examples/3dtiles_batch_table.html for an example.
* C3DTExtensions expects for an object extending
C3DTAbstractExtension to manage a registered extension instead
of a parser.
* Rename core 3D Tiles classes: $3DTilesExtensions
becomes C3DTExtensions and $3dTilesAbstractExtension becomes
C3DTAbstractExtension and BatchTableHierarchyExtension becomes
C3DTBatchTableHierarchyExtension.

* New classes maching the 3D Tiles specification:
C3DTBatchTable, C3DTBoundingVolume, C3DTileset.

* Add attributes to 3D Tiles core classes indicating their type

* 3D Tiles tests updated.

* 3D Tiles documentation updated.
* **style:** `Style#text.halo` is not available anymore, and each
property of it as been place in the `text` object, with the `halo`
prefix: `haloWidth`, `haloColor` and `haloBlur`.
* **core:** `Feature#geometry` is no longer available, use
`Feature#geometries` instead.
* **style:** `Style#getTextAnchorPositionInCSS` has been renamed to
`Style#getTextAnchorPosition`.
* **view:** the signature of View#pickFeaturesAt has changed
* **style:** Style#setFromVectorTile no longer has a `zoom`
parameter. The `zoom` value is equal to `Style#minzoom`.
* **FileSource:** Source must be in Layer constructor options.
You couldn't add a source after a Layer instancing.
* **source:** To instance C3DtilesLayer, it's needed to instance C3DtilesSource too.
* **DEMUtils:** the method `DEMUtils.getElevationValueAt` only returns
a value now, if you want the previous object, use
`DEMUtils.getTerrainObjectAt` instead.
* **PointCloud:** To add points cloud, you need to instance:
- PointCloudSource to specify parameters to fetch data.
- PointCloudLayer to add this points cloud in viewer.
* **view:** Constructor signature changes.
* **source:** The projection option to instance a TMS and WMTS source is mandatory.
* **core:** * `x()`, `y()`, `z()`, `latitude()`, `longitude()` and `altitude()` have
been replaced by getters of the same names
* `setAltitude()` has been replaced by a setter on `altitude`
* the validity of a CRS is no longer check when doing conversion using
`as()`, so it needs to be checked beforehand if needed
* **view:** Adding a layer to a view, with a source not
instantiated (only as an object) is no longer supported, even in
deprecation mode.
* **core:** * crs() and this._crs, west(), east(), south() and north() are replaced by this.crs and getter west, east, south and north.
* The Function Extent.extentParent has renamed to Extent.tiledExtentParent.
* Remove PanoramaView, PanoramaLayer, StaticSource and PanoramaTileBuilder.
* **parser:** GpxParser doesn't return a THREE.Mesh anymore.
* **core:** Computing screen space error is changed, so tile subdivision are different.
* **renderer:** the API of TileMesh and LayeredMaterial have changed.
* **renderer:** LayeredMaterialConstants and RendererConstant have
been removed.
* **source:** the origin property of TMSSource has been replaced by a
boolean, isInverted, that serves the same goal, but using a boolean.
* **source:** the protocol property no longer exists, instead to test
the type of Source, one needs to use the property isSource, adapted to
each type: for example, isWMTSSource tells if the source is WMTSSource.
* **layer:** layer.options.mimetype is no longer supported, use
layer.format instead
* **gis:** ellipsoidSizes from Coordinates.js is no longer a
function but an object.
* **core:** change view.notifyChange signature and semantics
* **Core:** Before this change, `view.addLayer` was throwing some errors directly in
some cases, and rejecting the promise in others. This replaces the
former for the latter in all cases. If you relied on a try/catch block
surrounding `view.addLayer` to catch some undocumented errors, you need
to move your error handling code to your promise rejection handler.
* **core:** this modify the signature of all picking functions.
* the signature of Fetcher.texture has changed, and only
return a promise now, instead of an object containing the texture and
the promise.
* **core:** a Provider needs to return a Promise every time after
calling its executeCommand function.
* **vector:** feature collection are not merged anymore
* **vector:** GeoJSON2Feature now returns a Promise
* **core:** c3DEngine.renderViewTobuffer has been renamed renderViewToBuffer
and has a new signature.
* - `layer.options.mimetype` is removed in favor of `layer.format`.
- `WFS_Provider`: format should now be a proper mimetype. So `json`
  becomes `application/json`, `geojson` becomes `application/geojson`.
* **core:** KML_Provider and BuildingBox_Provider have been
removed, as well as getPointOrder from WFS_Provider.
